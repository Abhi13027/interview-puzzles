# 45 minutes using ropes

The solution to this puzzle lies in the fact that if we burn the rope from both the ends, we double the rate of burning.

Take the first rope, and burn it from both the ends. At the same time, burn the other rope from one of the ends.

Now when the first rope will completely burn, we will be sure that half an hour is passed away as the rope takes 1 hour to burn completely if it is put on fire from one of the ends.

As soon as the first rope is completely burnt, put the other end of the 2nd rope also on fire. Since only half an hour was left and we put it on fire from the other end, it will take only 15mins to completely burn itself.
